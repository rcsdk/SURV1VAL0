SURV1VAL0 🛡️

Post-Compromise Survival & Digital Self-Defense FrameworkFrom BIOS to Android. From Forensics to Full Recovery. Built by a survivor — for survivors.

🚀 Mission

SURV1VAL0 is a battle-tested, modular cybersecurity suite for pros who already got hit — and refuse to stay down.This isn’t prevention. This is digital resilience. When the system is compromised, SURV1VAL0 gives you control, visibility, and a way back.

No fluff. No dashboards-for-show. Real tools. Real response.

Survival, because we bend but we don't break.

📄 What Is It?

SURV1VAL0 is:

A post-compromise toolkit for Linux + Android

A modular ops framework for recovery, lockdown, and forensics

A personal command center built around real-world paranoia

A launchpad for professionals who need control after a breach

Built by a creative director & cybersecurity ops leader who lived through bootkits, persistent Android infections, BIOS compromises, and offline recovery ops.

 "The very day I was about to climb the biggest mountain in France on top of a Collnago road bike show it was 3:30 in the morning I looked up, it was a very cold day,,,, the giant is so high that you don't see the top of it cuz it's up in the skies.... And then I had one of the most frank conversations with myself...I said...."Daniel...you can do something extraordinary today - you can be the firs brazilian cycler to cliimb in  one go. Not allowed to unclip. But will be a jewel you will have only for you forever, and them you be able to give this to others. But you got to do it. Ittś not about you anymore, its about a legacy so others may come....so in very simple terms: do it. or die. You well prepared to easily surspass any possible form of pain, so no excuses. You deserve. This is the right place, exact time. You got this team os Pros in the van lookng for you. Just now stand up, sweap your tears, say thank you to God and to all of the team. Climb your bike and do this shit. In one go, You have less than 6 hours. Starting to count now."
