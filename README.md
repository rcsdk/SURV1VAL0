# SURV1VAL0 🛡️
**Post-Compromise Survival & Digital Self-Defense Kit**  
*From BIOS to Android. From Forensics to Full Recovery.*  
**Built by a survivor — for survivors.**

---

## 🚀 Mission
SURV1VAL0 is a battle-tested, modular cybersecurity suite for pros who already got hit — and refuse to stay down.

> This isn’t prevention. This is digital resilience. When the system is compromised, SURV1VAL0 gives you control, visibility, and a way back.

Survival, because we bend but we don't break.

## 📄 What Is It?
SURV1VAL0 is:
- A post-compromise toolkit for Linux + Android
- A modular ops framework for recovery, lockdown, and forensics
- A personal command center built around real-world paranoia
- A launchpad for professionals who need control after a breach

Built by a Creative Director & cybersecurity ops leader who lived through bootkits, persistent Android infections, BIOS compromises, and offline recovery ops.
